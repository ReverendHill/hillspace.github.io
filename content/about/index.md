## About Me
I am a seasoned Site Reliability Engineer with over a decade of experience in optimizing and managing complex, high-availability systems. My career has been dedicated to ensuring the reliability, scalability, and performance of mission-critical infrastructures in various industries. With a strong foundation in cloud architecture, automation, and DevOps practices, I have successfully designed and implemented large-scale solutions that improve system uptime, reduce operational toil, and enhance deployment pipelines.

I thrive in fast-paced environments, leading cross-functional teams to deliver robust, scalable, and automated infrastructure solutions. From implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with tools like Terraform and Pulumi to building efficient CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Argo CD, I am passionate about creating systems that improve efficiency and reliability. I also bring deep expertise in observability and monitoring tools, including Grafana, Prometheus, and Datadog, ensuring that systems are proactive in mitigating potential issues.

Driven by a passion for innovation, I am always seeking new challenges and learning opportunities, aiming to build solutions that not only meet current needs but also anticipate future growth. Whether it's optimizing cloud infrastructure, driving automation initiatives, or leading postmortems to improve processes, I am committed to delivering results that matter.

In my free time, I like writing technical blog posts, working on my project car, camping, hiking, and learning new languages.
