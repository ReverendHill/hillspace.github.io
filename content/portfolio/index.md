During my time at Fox, I was instrumental in maintaining high-performance infrastructure for critical systems supporting the network's digital operations. I worked on building and enhancing cloud environments, implementing best practices for reliability and scalability, and improving the monitoring and observability of applications using Grafana and AWS Cloudwatch. I led efforts in load testing and capacity planning in order to prepare for large events such as the Super Bowl, World Series, World Cup, and NFL events. Using the k6 library, I created a high-volume load generator that achieved over 30,000 request per second.

By collaborating with cross-functional teams, I played a key role in optimizing performance and reducing system downtime, helping Fox deliver a superior user experience. My work contributed to streamlining operational processes, improving infrastructure automation, and ensuring the scalability of Fox's platforms to handle increasing demand. Through my efforts, I helped improve system resiliency and foster a more efficient and reliable technical environment at Fox.

This was my first leadership role as a Lead Site Reliability Engineer, which enabled to me to make strategic decisions and mentor other SRE members on my team. This leadership experience gave me great insight on what it takes to be a good leader, how a leader should act, and how to efficiently balance communications between executives and developers.
